 <!-- I have three old hp monitors, not new. I want to sell it on my own website. That’s why I should create a product upload form on my website, then upload my product with specification and available quantity. My monitors have a 15.6 inch display. My monitor’s VGA cable status, yes, I will sell it for 8000 tk.

For creating a product upload form what specifications will be uploaded and what will be their data types?  -->

<?php
$monitorQuantity = "three";  //Datatype is string

$moniter_name = "hp" ;       //Datatype is string

$Is_moniter_condition_old = true;   //Datatype is Boolean

$Moniter_size =   15.6;      //Datatype is double/float

$moniter_cable_status= "VGA";//Datatype is string or
$is_moniter_cable_status_VGA = true; //Datatype is Boolean

$sellPrice = 8000 ;         //Datatype is integer
